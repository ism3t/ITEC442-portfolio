                        <p>
                          I was born on March 2, 2002, in London, United Kingdom. Shortly after my birth, 
                          my family relocated to North Cyprus. Currently, I am a 21-year-old student pursuing 
                          a degree in information technology at Eastern Mediterranean University.

                 <h2>Introduction of Cyber Security </h2>
                 <div>Cybersecurity refers to the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access,
                     theft, damage, and other cyber threats. It involves implementing measures and technologies to ensure the confidentiality,
                     integrity, and availability of information in digital form. Cybersecurity aims to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data,
                     safeguard against malware and viruses, detect and respond to security incidents, and maintain the overall security posture of an 
                     organization or individual. It encompasses various strategies, including the use of firewalls, encryption, authentication, intrusion
                     detection systems, and security awareness training, among others, to mitigate risks and ensure the security of digital assets. </div>

                     <div>What is a 'fully digital enterprise'?</div><br><br>
                     <div>  -A fully digital enterprise is an organization that has embraced digital technologies across all its operations, processes, and interactions. It relies on digital tools to automate and optimize its business processes, uses data analytics for decision-making, provides a seamless digital experience to customers, adapts quickly to market changes, fosters innovation, promotes collaboration, and prioritizes cybersecurity and data privacy. By going digital, businesses can streamline operations, improve efficiency, enhance customer experiences, and gain a competitive advantage.</div><br> 
                     <br><div>What are the cyber Security challenges/concerns with a fully digital enterprise?</div><br><br>
                     <div>  -The cybersecurity challenges in a fully digital enterprise include data breaches, malware attacks, insider threats, phishing, cloud security risks, compliance requirements, and a shortage of skilled cybersecurity professionals.</div><br> 
                     <div>-Data breaches: The risk of data breaches increases as more data is generated and stored digitally. Cybercriminals may attempt to gain unauthorized access to sensitive customer information, intellectual property, or financial data, leading to financial losses and reputational damage.</div><br>
                     <div>-Malware and ransomware attacks: Digital enterprises are vulnerable to malware and ransomware attacks, where malicious software is used to disrupt operations, steal data, or demand a ransom. Such attacks can cripple systems, cause financial losses, and disrupt business continuity.</div><br>
                     <div>-Insider threats: While digital transformation brings numerous benefits, it also increases the risk of insider threats. Employees or contractors with access to sensitive data may intentionally or unintentionally misuse or leak it, leading to data breaches or other security incidents.</div><br>
                     <div>-Phishing and social engineering: Cybercriminals often employ phishing techniques and social engineering tactics to deceive employees into revealing sensitive information or granting unauthorized access. These attacks can compromise security credentials and provide a gateway for further breaches.</div><br>
                     <div>-Cloud security: Digital enterprises rely on cloud services for storage, processing, and collaboration. However, ensuring the security of cloud environments and data stored in the cloud can be challenging. Misconfigurations, weak access controls, or vulnerabilities in cloud infrastructure can expose sensitive data to unauthorized access.</div><br>
                     <br><div>What are the cyber security challenges for a bricks and mortar SME wanting to become a digital enterprise?</div><br><br>
                     <div>-Bricks and mortar SMEs transitioning to digital enterprises face cybersecurity challenges such as limited resources, lack of expertise, vulnerability to phishing and malware attacks, and compliance with data protection regulations.</div><br> 
                     <div>-Adoption of new technologies: Incorporating digital technologies introduces new security risks as SMEs may lack the expertise or resources to properly assess and implement robust security measures for unfamiliar digital platforms and tools.</div><br> 
                     <div>-Limited cybersecurity knowledge and awareness: SMEs often have limited resources and may not possess dedicated cybersecurity teams or personnel. This can lead to a lack of awareness about common cyber threats, best practices, and the importance of implementing strong security measures.</div><br>
                     <div>-Budget constraints: SMEs typically have limited budgets allocated for cybersecurity, making it challenging to invest in comprehensive security solutions, technologies, and ongoing monitoring to effectively protect their digital assets.</div><br>
                     <div>-Phishing and social engineering attacks: SMEs may be targeted by phishing attacks, where cybercriminals trick employees into divulging sensitive information or granting unauthorized access. The lack of cybersecurity awareness and training makes SMEs more susceptible to such social engineering tactics.</div><br>
                     <div>-Vulnerability to ransomware and malware: Ransomware attacks, where malicious software encrypts critical data and demands a ransom for its release, can significantly disrupt SME operations. The limited resources and backup capabilities of SMEs make them attractive targets for cybercriminals.</div><br>
                     <div>-Third-party risks: As SMEs embrace digital transformation, they may rely on third-party vendors or service providers for digital solutions, such as cloud services or e-commerce platforms. However, inadequate security measures by these external entities can introduce vulnerabilities into the SME's digital infrastructure.</div><br>
                     <br><div>Do you agree with the views expressed, especially in light of the 'energy crisis' experienced worldwide in 2022</div><br><br>
                     <div>  -Energy distribution and sourcing could be made better through the use of data from all over the digital industry; it is crucial that global energy providers continue improving digitalization while also strengthening their networks (Booth et al., 2019). </div><br>

                     <div>The digital economy offers benefits like enhanced accessibility and efficiency, but it also poses cybersecurity challenges for brick and mortar and fully digital SMEs.

                     <h2>Reflection</h2>
                  <div>When I read about the SolarWind strike, I was incredibly amazed by how perfectly the attack was planned and carried out while carefully considering every little aspect. If you ask me, it was a masterpiece. However, this attack demonstrated that there is always room for improvement, we shouldn't ever put a great deal of confidence in ourselves, and always implement the required security measurements.</div>

                 <h2>8-Cyber Security Challenges in Digital Economy</h2>
                     <div>Spremić (2018) conducted a preliminary research on the management of cyber security in organizations associated with critical national infrastructure. The study focused on large companies in Croatia and aimed to evaluate the maturity and effectiveness of basic and advanced controls for mitigating cyber threats. The research involved a survey questionnaire and in-depth interviews with IT/cyber security experts from nine sampled companies. The findings indicated that these organizations have efficient basic organizational and technical controls in place to mitigate regular cyber threats. However, there were identified challenges related to employee awareness, education, technical skills, competent experts, and the effectiveness of preventive and detective controls. The research highlighted the importance of a more holistic and collective approach to cyber security management, emphasizing that it should be the responsibility of every employee and the ecosystem of the organization. The study also pointed out the need for increased adoption of advanced and sophisticated controls. Although this preliminary research had limitations due to the small sample size, it provides valuable insights for future studies on cyber security management in organizations associated with critical national infrastructure.</div><br>
